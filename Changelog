  * x86_64 support
  * Couple of new config variables
  * Proper UTF-8 handling (at the cost of an added dependency)
  * Much smoother installation procedure (the strace step is now scripted)

  * Changed setup so that user nobody should own no files in rt whatsoever (and is therefore unable to chmod them either, removing an avenue of potential DoS attacks).
  * Shuffled around some of the installation steps, and updated the examples at the end.

  * Removed -ftrapv because it caused segfaults in combination with certain other flags, most likely due to a gcc bug.
  * Report signal descriptions rather than numbers, and names instead of numbers of disallowed system calls.
  * Customizable source code templates using preprocessor macros in prelude.h
